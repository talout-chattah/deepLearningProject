# Continual Learning Through Synaptic Intelligence

This repository contains code to reproduce the key findings of our path integral approach to prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual learning.

## Requirements

We have tested this maintenance release (v1.1) with the following configuration:

* Python 3.5.2
* Jupyter 4.4.0
* Tensorflow 1.10
* Keras 2.2.2

Kudos to Mitra (https://github.com/MitraDarja) for making our code conform with Keras 2.2.2!


### Earlier releases 

For the original release (v1.0) we used the following configuration of the libraries which were available at the time:

* Python 3.5.2
* Jupyter 4.3.0
* Tensorflow 1.2.1
* Keras 2.0.5

To revert to such a environment we suggest using virtualenv (https://virtualenv.pypa.io):

```
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -vI keras==2.0.5
pip3 install jupyter matplotlib numpy tensorflow-gpu tqdm seaborn
```
